		<h3>Overview</h3>
			<p> 
				With deep-massive-parallel sequencing molecular biology is turning into a "<i>data-rich</i>" science. 
				Thanks to Next-Generation Sequencers, Mass Spectrometry, Bioassay Technology and other Bioinformatics Big-Data Techniques 
				it is nowadays possible to have at the same time both a "bird's eye" and a "magnified" overview on a biological sample.
				But this huge amount of raw data is of little use without cutting-edge bioinformatics and biostatistics methodologies
				able to disentangle, process, analyze, and interpret them. Therefore my research efforts are focused on the development 
				and application of machine learning techniques for the analysis of complex biomolecular data.
			</p>
			<p>
				I would like to strike a balance between two modes of doing research. On one hand I would like to focus on the design, 
				development and application of novel computational, statistical and machine learning methods for analyzing and integrating different data 
				sources to extract the interesting "<i>needles</i>"" of medical and biological insight from the big "<i>haystack</i>" of high-dimensional 
				bio-molecular data.	On the other hand, I would like to package such approaches into modular, scalable and user-friendly 
				software tools in order to make them available to the research community at large (have a look at my
				<a href="software.html"> Software</a> page). 
				<!-- So the last goal of my research is making cutting-edge bioinformatics methodologies and make them available to 
				the research community at large.  -->
			</p>
			 
		<h3>Bioinformatics vs Computational Biology</h3>
			<p>
				Even if Bioinformatics and Computational Biology are often considered synonymous, I believe they are conceptually
				separated and it is worth distinguishing them.
				<!-- separated by a slight difference and so it is worth distinguishing them: -->
			</p>
			<ul class="research">
				<li class="research">
					<b>Computational Biology</b>: is the study of Biology using computational techniques. The main goal of a 
					computational biologist is to make new insights about Biology and living system. 
					Then <b>Computational Biology</b> is about <b>Science</b>.
				</li>
				<li class="research">
					<b>Bioinformatics</b>: is about the creation of new algorithms able to solve problems. The main goal of a 
					bioinformatician is to build tools that can work on biological, medical and pharmaceutical data. 
					Then <b>Bioinformatics</b> is about <b>Computer Science</b>.
				</li>
			</ul>
			
			<p>
				When I <i>design</i> new methodologies I am involved in a Computer Science activity. 
				I design algorithms not to solve just a single specific problem, but a class of similar problems in Medicine or Molecular Biology.
			</p>
			
			<p>
				When I use my software (or those of others) to <i>answer</i> biomedical questions, I am doing science and 
				I am making inferences in the field of Molecular Biology or Medicine.
			</p>

			<p>
				Anyway, despite the difference between Bioinformatics and Computational Biology sounds apparently easy and clear, 
				I believe that dealing with complex computational issues without losing sight of the medical/biological point of view, 
				is simultaneously challenging and captivating!!
			</p>

		<h3>Research Interests</h3>
			<p>
				My research interests touch the fields of Bioinformatics, Computational Biology and Machine Learning. More precisely,
				my research lines can be grouped as follow:
			</p>
			<ol class="research">
				<li class="research">
					<b>BIO-MOLECULAR NETWORKS</b>:<br> analysis and construction of complex biomolecular networks by making use of database such as
					<a href="http://string-db.org/">STRING</a>, <a href="https://thebiogrid.org/">BioGRID</a> and 
					<a href="http://www.uniprot.org/">UniProt</a>;
				</li>
				<li class="research">
					<b>FLAT LEARNING METHODS</b>:<br> application of both supervised and semi-supervised learning methods to make "flat" predictions,
					i.e. predictions that do not consider the hierarchical structure of the label space;					
				</li>
				<li class="research">
					<b>OUTPUT STRUCTURED PREDICTIONS</b>:<br> design and software implementation of hierarchical ensemble methods (HEMs) for the 
					prediction of protein function (an open fundamental challenge in molecular biology) and for the prediction of human gene-abnormal 
					phenotype associations (a crucial step to discover novel genes associated to Mendelian diseases). 
					The HEMs' predictions are consistent with the ontology predictions, because they always obey to the "<i>true path rule</i>", 
					the logical rule that governs the internal coherence of the biological ontologies, such as the Gene Ontology 
					(<a href="http://www.geneontology.org/">GO</a>) and 
					the Human Phenotype Ontology (<a href="http://human-phenotype-ontology.github.io/">HPO</a>).
