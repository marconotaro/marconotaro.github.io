    <h3>Overview</h3>
      <p>
        Thanks to high-throughput biotechnologies, we are assisting to a massive stacking of genomic, transcriptomic, proteomic and
        metabolomic data. Molecular biology is nowadays turning into a <i>"data-rich"</i> science.
        This unprecedented richness of raw data is meaningless until we cannot extract the interesting and useful
        "<i>needles</i>" of information from the big "<i>haystack</i>" of available data.
        This allow to us to have at the same time both a "<i>birdâ€™s eye</i>" and a "<i>magnified</i>" overview on a biological
        sample from a wide range of medically relevant disorders. <i>"The answer is there, blowing in the bulk"</i> (thanks Zimmerman &#128515;).
        However, this huge amount of raw data is of little use without groundbreaking bioinformatics and biostatistics methodologies
        able to disentangle, process, analyze and interpret them.
      </p>
      <p>
        In my research, I would like to strike a balance between two ways of doing science. On one hand I would like to focus on the
        design, development and application of novel statistical and machine learning approaches for analyzing heterogeneous and high-dimensional
        biomedical data. On the other hand, I would like to package such approaches into modular, scalable and user-friendly software tools,
        in order to make them available to the scientific community at large (have a look at my <a href="software.html"> Software</a> page).
      </p>

    <h3>Bioinformatics vs Computational Biology</h3>
      <p>
        Even if Bioinformatics and Computational Biology are often considered synonymous, I believe they are conceptually
        separated and it is worth distinguishing them.
      </p>
      <ul class="interest">
        <li class="interest">
          <b>Computational Biology</b>: is the study of Biology using computational techniques. The main goal of a
          computational biologist is to make new insights about Biology and living system.
          Then Computational Biology is about <b>Science</b>.
        </li>
        <li class="interest">
          <b>Bioinformatics</b>: is about the creation of new algorithms able to solve problems. The main goal of a
          bioinformatician is to build tools that can work on biological, medical and pharmaceutical data.
          Then Bioinformatics is about <b>Computer Science</b>.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        When I <i>design</i> new methodologies I am involved in a Computer Science activity.
        I design algorithms not to solve just a single specific problem, but a class of similar problems in Medicine or Molecular Biology.
      </p>

      <p>
        When I use my software (or those of others) to <i>answer</i> biomedical questions, I am doing science and
        I am making inferences in the field of Molecular Biology or Medicine.
      </p>

      <p>
        Anyway, despite the difference between Bioinformatics and Computational Biology sounds apparently easy and clear,
        I believe that dealing with complex computational issues without losing sight of the medical/biological point of view,
        is simultaneously challenging and captivating!!
      </p>

    <h3>Area of Interests</h3>
      <ol class="interest">
        <li class="interest">
          <b>BIO-MOLECULAR NETWORKS</b><br> analysis and construction of complex biomolecular networks by making use of database such as
          <a href="http://string-db.org/">STRING</a>, <a href="https://thebiogrid.org/">BioGRID</a> and <a href="http://www.uniprot.org/">UniProt</a>;
        </li>
        <li class="interest">
          <b>FLAT LEARNING METHODS</b><br> application of both supervised and semi-supervised learning methods to make "flat" predictions,
          i.e. predictions that do not consider the hierarchical structure of the label space;
        </li>
        <li class="interest">
          <b>OUTPUT STRUCTURED LEARNING</b><br> design and software implementation of hierarchical ensemble methods (HEMs) for the
          prediction of protein function (an open fundamental challenge in molecular biology) and for the prediction of human gene-abnormal
          phenotype associations (a crucial step to discover novel genes associated to Mendelian diseases).
          The HEMs' predictions are consistent with the ontology predictions, because they always obey to the "<i>true path rule</i>",
          the logical and biological rule that governs the internal coherence of the bio-ontologies, such as the Gene Ontology
          (<a href="http://www.geneontology.org/">GO</a>) and the Human Phenotype Ontology (<a href="http://human-phenotype-ontology.github.io/">HPO</a>).
        </li>
        <li class="interest">
          <b>NEXT GENERATION SEQUENCING</b><br> application of computational tools for the analysis of genetic variants in sequencing data, such as copy number,
          single nucleotide variants, INDELs and the analysis of next-generation RNA/ATAC/ChIP-Seq data sequencing data.
        </li>
        <li class="interest">
          <b>MULTI-OMICS DATA</b><br> disentangling multi-omics data through statistical approaches and building up shiny applications to support clients
          in the process of hypotheses generation.
